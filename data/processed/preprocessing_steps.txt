Hotel Booking Dataset Preprocessing Documentation
===========================================

This document describes the preprocessing steps applied to create the clean dataset (clean_training_set.csv).

Dataset Statistics:
-----------------
- Original rows: 4,958,347
- Processed in: 50 chunks of 100,000 rows each
- Output file size: 877.51 MB

Preprocessing Steps:
------------------

1. Price Outlier Handling:
   - Applied price caps based on hotel star rating:
     * Unrated/0-star: $1,000
     * 1-star: $500
     * 2-star: $1,000
     * 3-star: $2,000
     * 4-star: $5,000
     * 5-star: $10,000

2. Competitor Data Processing:
   - Created binary flags for competitor rate availability (comp1_available to comp8_available)
   - Calculated total number of available competitor rates
   - Computed mean price difference with competitors where rates are available
   - Missing competitor rates treated as unavailable (0)

3. Location Score Processing:
   - Handled missing prop_location_score2 (22% missing)
   - Used simple imputation: location_score2 = location_score1 * 0.7
   - Maintains relative location quality while accounting for typically lower secondary scores

4. Distance Processing:
   - Handled missing orig_destination_distance (32% missing)
   - Applied rule-based imputation:
     * Same country searches: 50 distance units
     * Different country searches: 500 distance units
   - Preserves the domestic vs. international search pattern

5. Review Score Processing:
   - Handled missing review scores (0.15% missing)
   - Imputed missing values with mean score per star rating
   - Preserves rating patterns within hotel categories

6. Historical Data Processing:
   - Created binary flag 'has_booking_history'
   - Handled missing historical data (95% missing):
     * visitor_hist_starrating: filled with 0
     * visitor_hist_adr_usd: filled with 0
   - Missing values indicate no previous bookings

7. Numerical Feature Normalization:
   - Applied to key numerical features:
     * price_usd
     * orig_destination_distance
     * prop_location_score1
     * prop_location_score2
     * prop_review_score
     * prop_log_historical_price
   - Used StandardScaler (zero mean, unit variance)

Output Features:
--------------
The cleaned dataset includes all original features plus:
1. New binary flags:
   - comp1_available to comp8_available
   - has_booking_history

2. Aggregated competitor metrics:
   - comp_rates_available (count of available competitor rates)
   - mean_comp_price_diff (average price difference with competitors)

3. Normalized versions of numerical features

Usage Notes:
-----------
1. The cleaned dataset is ready for model training
2. All numerical features are normalized
3. No missing values remain in the dataset
4. New features provide additional signals for the learning-to-rank problem
5. Original raw data is preserved, all transformations are reversible
